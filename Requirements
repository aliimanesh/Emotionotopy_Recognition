# Requirements for the Pupil and PPG Data Processing, Feature Extraction, and Model Building Project

# Core libraries
numpy                 # Provides support for array operations and mathematical functions
pandas                # Essential for data manipulation and analysis, specifically with dataframes
matplotlib            # Used for data visualization, such as plotting data trends

# Scientific and Machine Learning Libraries
scipy                 # Used for interpolation and signal processing (savgol_filter, interp1d)
scikit-learn          # Includes metrics, model selection, and preprocessing for machine learning

# Deep Learning Library
tensorflow            # Deep learning framework with Keras APIs for building neural networks

# Colab-Specific Library (Optional)
google-colab          # For integrating with Google Colab;
