# Emotionotopy_Recognition
This repository contains the codes I used to train an emotion recognition model based on the Emotionotopy emotion model.

(OSF Link: https://osf.io/hve5j/)


Here is the explanation for codes:

*Code numbers 1,2,3 are for preprocessing Pupil diameter data and creating a dataframe.

('1-Pupil_Preprocess_Dataframe', '2_Pupil_FeatureExtraction', '3_Pupil_Diminished')



*Code numbers 4,5 are for preprocessing PPG Signal and creating a dataframe. 

('4-PPG_Preprocess_Dataframe', '5_PPG_Diminished')



*Code number 6 is for preprocessing the emotion labels.

('6-Emotion_Labels_Preprocess')


*I have trained 6 models, and all the corresponding codes start with '7':

'7-Model-01-CNN-MLP', '7-Model-02-CNN-LSTM', '7-Model-03-CNN-MLP-Bias'
'7-Model-04-CNN-LSTM-Bias', '7-Model-05-CNN-MLP-PPG', '7-Model-06-CNN-LSTM-PPG'
